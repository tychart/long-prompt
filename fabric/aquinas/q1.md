This is a fascinating passage from St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiæ, where he discusses the multiple senses of Scripture (literally translated as "Holy Writ" in the passage).

**Summary**

Aquinas argues that Holy Writ transcends every science because it not only describes facts but also reveals mysteries. He claims that God is the author of Holy Writ and has the power to signify His meaning through words and things themselves. As a result, Scripture has a spiritual sense beyond its literal meaning.

He identifies four senses:

1. **Literal** (historical or literal): The first signification whereby words signify things.
2. **Allegorical**: So far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of the New Law.
3. **Moral** (tropological): So far as the things done in Christ, or so far as the things which signify Christ, are types of what we ought to do.
4. **Anagogical** (contemplative): So far as they signify what relates to eternal glory.

He also addresses three objections:

1. The multiplicity of senses does not produce equivocation and does not imply that Scripture contains contradictory truth.
2. These four senses are grouped under the literal sense, but allegory stands for the three spiritual senses.
3. The parabolical (figurative) sense is contained in the literal, as words signify things properly and figuratively.

**Key Points**

* Holy Writ has a unique capacity to transcend every science because it reveals mysteries beyond facts.
* God, as the author of Scripture, can signify His meaning through both words and things themselves.
* There are four senses of Scripture: literal, allegorical, moral (tropological), and anagogical (contemplative).
* The multiplicity of senses does not imply equivocation or contradictory truth.
* The parabolical sense is contained in the literal sense.

**Context**

This passage is from Book I of the Summa Theologiæ, which deals with questions related to God's existence, nature, and revelation. Aquinas' discussion of Scripture and its multiple senses reflects his broader theological concerns, particularly his interest in understanding how faith and reason interact.

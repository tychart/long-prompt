Here's a modern language summary of the text:

**Question 1: Is Sacred Doctrine Necessary?**

Is it important for us to know these spiritual truths? Are they more like science or magic? Should we try to understand them in a way that's practical and useful, or is it okay if they're just abstract concepts?

The main point is that sacred doctrine is not just about human reason, but also about receiving truth from God.

**Article 1: Do We Need Any More Knowledge Besides Philosophy?**

Some people think that since we already have philosophical knowledge, we don't need anything else. But others argue that there's more to life than what our brains can figure out using reason alone.

The main point is that sacred doctrine is necessary for our salvation and spiritual growth. God reveals certain truths to us that are beyond human reason, so we need to trust in those revelations.

**Article 2: Is Sacred Doctrine a Science?**

Some people think that science only deals with things that can be proven through evidence and logic. But others argue that sacred doctrine is more like science because it's based on principles and truths revealed by God.

The main point is that sacred doctrine is indeed a science, but one that operates under a different set of rules than secular sciences. It relies on the truth of God, which is self-evident in its own way.

**Summary Points**

* Sacred doctrine is not just about human reason, but also about receiving truth from God.
* We need sacred doctrine for our spiritual growth and salvation.
* Sacred doctrine is a science that operates under different principles than secular sciences.
* Its truths are revealed by God and rely on the trust of faith.

Here are the summaries:

**Article 3: Is Sacred Doctrine One Science?**

Some people think sacred doctrine isn't just one science because it talks about God and humans, angels, and morality, which can be divided into different areas of study.

But others argue that sacred doctrine is actually one science because it looks at things from a specific perspective - the formal aspect of being divinely revealed. This means that whatever is revealed by God shares a common object or formality, making sacred doctrine a single science.

**Response to Objection 1**

Sacred doctrine doesn't treat God and creatures equally, but focuses on God primarily, which doesn't affect its unity as a science.

**Response to Objection 2**

Just like the "common sense" can cover multiple areas of study under one aspect, sacred doctrine can also encompass different philosophical sciences while still being a single science. Its focus on divine revelation makes it unique and not limited by human reason alone.

**Article 4: Is Sacred Doctrine a Practical Science?**

Some people think sacred doctrine is a practical science because it guides us to action (e.g., "Be ye doers of the word").

However, others argue that sacred doctrine is more focused on understanding God's nature and works, rather than just giving instructions for human actions. It's not just about doing things, but also about knowing and understanding.

**Response**

Sacred doctrine includes both practical and speculative aspects because it considers how divine revelation applies to different areas of study, including human operations like morality and law. While it's more focused on the divine, it still has a role in guiding us towards eternal bliss.

**Article 5: Is Sacred Doctrine Nobler than Other Sciences?**

Some people think sacred doctrine isn't necessarily nobler because its principles (like faith) can be doubted, making other sciences seem more certain.

However, others argue that sacred doctrine is actually more noble because it's about understanding the nature of God and His works, which are considered higher and more important than human knowledge.

Here are the summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 3: Is Sacred Doctrine a Unified Science?**

Sacred doctrine is considered more unified than other speculative sciences because it's based on divine knowledge, which can't be misled. In contrast, other sciences rely on human reason, which can make mistakes.

However, some might argue that sacred doctrine isn't just one science, but rather encompasses multiple areas of study under a single umbrella. The key difference is that sacred doctrine focuses primarily on God and His nature, making it unique and not limited by human reason alone.

**Response**

Just like common sense can cover multiple areas of study under a single aspect, sacred doctrine can also encompass different philosophical sciences while still being a single science. Its focus on divine revelation makes it stand out from other areas of inquiry.

**Article 4: Is Sacred Doctrine a Practical Science?**

Some people think sacred doctrine is more focused on understanding God's nature and works rather than just giving instructions for human actions.

However, others argue that sacred doctrine includes both practical and speculative aspects because it considers how divine revelation applies to different areas of study. While it's not solely about doing things, it still has a role in guiding us towards eternal bliss.

**Response**

Sacred doctrine combines both practical and theoretical approaches because it explores how divine revelation applies to human operations like morality and law. While it's not just about following rules, it also provides guidance on how to live a virtuous life.

**Article 5: Is Sacred Doctrine Wisdom?**

Some people think wisdom is limited to human knowledge and reason, but others argue that sacred doctrine represents the ultimate form of wisdom.

According to Augustine, wisdom is the knowledge of divine things. Since sacred doctrine treats of God as the highest cause, it's especially called wisdom.

**Response**

Sacred doctrine derives its principles not from human knowledge, but from divine knowledge. This means that it has a unique perspective on truth and can provide guidance on how to live a virtuous life.

In contrast to other sciences, sacred doctrine doesn't need to prove its principles through natural reason or observation. Instead, it relies on revelation and discerns what's true based on the wisdom of God.

**Response to Objections**

Regarding objections about sacred doctrine not being wisdom because it borrows principles from human knowledge:

* Sacred doctrine actually sets human knowledge in order through divine wisdom.
* The principles of other sciences either are evident or proved by natural reason, but the knowledge of sacred doctrine comes through revelation and is not subject to the same limitations.

Regarding objections that sacred doctrine lacks the virtue and inspiration of wisdom:

* Wisdom can be discerned in two ways: by inclination (through our virtues) and by knowledge.
* While we may not have the virtue itself, we can still judge correctly about virtuous acts with the guidance of divine wisdom.

Here's a SparkNotes-style summary of the text in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 3: What Counts as Wisdom?**

The first way we know what is wise is by having the Holy Spirit, which helps us understand things spiritually. This type of wisdom comes from God and can't be mistaken.

Dionysius says that Hierotheus learned about God through experience, not just by studying books.

**Question 7: Is God the Subject of This Science?**

Objection 1: Maybe God isn't the main subject of this science. If we can't even define what God is, how can we study Him?

Objection 2: Even if our conclusions about God are part of a bigger story, they're still connected to Him in some way.

**Answer:** The whole point of this science is that everything we talk about has a connection to God. We don't just focus on things themselves; we look at them through the lens of God's presence and power.

Some people think the object of this science might be something else, like signs or works of salvation. But as long as they have some connection to God, that makes sense.

**Article 8: Is Sacred Doctrine a Matter of Argument?**

Objection 1: Maybe we shouldn't use arguments in sacred doctrine because faith is what matters most. Ambrose says we should focus on faith rather than arguments.

Objection 2: If we're using arguments, they must be based on authority or reason. But if it's from authority, that wouldn't be very convincing. And if it's from reason, then faith would just get in the way!

**Answer:** Actually, our science works a bit differently. We don't use arguments to prove the basics of faith; instead, we build on those foundations to explore other truths. It's like using the resurrection of Christ as evidence for the general resurrection.

We can argue with people who deny certain articles of faith, but only if they're willing to admit some truth about God. If they refuse to do that, we can't use reason to prove our point; all we can do is answer their objections.

Here's a SparkNotes-style summary of the text in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Arguments from Authority**

The doctrine isn't trying to prove faith using reason, but rather uses arguments based on authority and revelation.

We need to trust the people who received divine revelation first (like the apostles and prophets), so we believe their teachings without questioning them. This type of argument is stronger than one based on human reason alone.

But just because our science relies on human reason, it doesn't mean faith can't use it either. In fact, faith builds upon reason as a foundation for exploring deeper truths.

Some people think that since faith should be the only thing we're concerned with, we shouldn't use arguments in sacred doctrine. But actually, faith is like a foundation â€“ and reason helps us understand how to apply that foundation.

**Sacred Doctrine and Scripture**

This science uses the authority of philosophers when it comes to questions they could figure out using their own reasoning (like Aratus said, "We are also His offspring"). We use these authorities as supporting evidence, but not as the ultimate proof.

The reason we don't just rely on personal revelations (which might be unreliable) is because our faith rests on what was written down by the apostles and prophets. That's why we trust the canonical books over other writings.

**Scripture and Metaphors**

Some people think it's a bad idea for scripture to use metaphors or similes, since poetry is all about that sort of thing and scriptures are more "serious".

But actually, using metaphors is fitting because humans naturally understand spiritual truths through comparisons with physical things (like how we learn from sense).

It's not about hiding the truth in metaphors â€“ it's actually a way to help people grasp abstract ideas by relating them to what they can understand.

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 10: Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses**

1. If we say that everything described by God's name must be taken literally, then it would be hard to understand some of the things God said.
2. This is because the descriptions are not just about what God does, but also about what He wants people to think and feel.

**Objection 1: That multiple senses in one text produce confusion**

1. If a word has many different meanings, it's easy for readers to get confused and misunderstand what they're reading.
2. This is because having many different meanings makes it hard to figure out which one is the most important or accurate.

**Answer: The author of Holy Scripture can use multiple senses without causing confusion**

1. We know that God can express Himself in different ways, so we don't have to worry about misunderstanding what He's saying.
2. In fact, using different senses helps us understand God better and get closer to Him.

**Objection 2: That the Old Testament has a fourfold division (history, etiology, analogy, allegory) which is not one of the four divisions mentioned in Objection 1**

1. The author thinks that these four divisions are all part of the same sense (the literal sense), and that they help us understand God's message better.
2. So, even if there are different ways to interpret what Scripture says, we can still figure out what God is trying to tell us.

**Objection 3: That the parabolical sense is contained in the literal sense**

1. This means that when Scripture uses a parable or a story to make a point, it's not talking about something literal like an arm or a leg.
2. Instead, it's using the story to convey a deeper meaning and message.

**Question 2: The existence of God**

**Article 1: Whether the existence of God is self-evident**

1. Some people think that if we can't understand why something exists, then it must exist because it's obvious.
2. This is similar to how we know things like "I am" or "I exist", because they're just facts about ourselves.

**Objection 1: That the existence of God is self-evident**

1. It seems that if God created everything and made us alive, then He must exist in order for all this to be possible.
2. So, it's not surprising that we can understand why God exists because it makes sense to our minds.

**Objection 2 (skipped)**

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 1: Whether the existence of God is self-evident**

1. Some people think that if we can't understand why something exists, then it must exist because it's obvious.
2. The idea behind this is similar to how we know things like "I am" or "I exist", because they're just facts about ourselves.

**Objection 1: That the existence of God is self-evident**

3. However, some argue that faith and belief can't be proven through reason alone.
4. They say that faith is about things we can't see, like God's existence, and therefore can't be proved by demonstration.

**Article 2: Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?**

1. Some people think that the existence of God can't be proven because it's something of faith, not reason.
2. They argue that faith is about things we can't see or understand, like God's existence, and therefore can't be proved by demonstration.

**Objection 1: That the essence is the middle term of demonstration**

3. Others argue that even if we knew what God's essence was, we wouldn't know how to demonstrate His existence.
4. They say that all we can infer from God's actions is what He doesn't do, not what He does.

**Objection 2: That there's no proportion between God and His effects**

5. Some argue that because God's effects are finite, they can't be used to prove His infinite existence.
6. They say that cause and effect can't be proven if the effect isn't proportional to the cause.

**Article 3: Demonstration can be made in two ways**

1. One way is through reason alone, without relying on faith or evidence.
2. The other way is through demonstration, which involves using evidence or proof to show that something exists.

Note: I've tried to preserve the original meaning and tone of the text, while making it more accessible to a modern audience. Let me know if you have any further requests!

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 1: Demonstration through effect**

1. There's another way to demonstrate something's existence, called a posteriori reasoning, which means we use what we know about an effect to figure out its cause.
2. When we know more about an effect than its cause, we can try to find the cause from the effect.

**Objection 1: That natural reason can't prove God exists**

3. Some people think that faith and belief are beyond reason, so there's no way to prove God's existence using logic alone.
4. They argue that faith is about things we can't see or understand, like God's existence, and therefore can't be proven by demonstration.

**Objection 2: That the middle term of demonstration is tricky**

5. Others argue that even if we knew what a cause was, we wouldn't know how to demonstrate its existence from an effect.
6. They say that all we can infer from an effect is what it doesn't do, not what it does.

**Objection 3: That effects aren't proportional to causes**

7. Some people think that because God's effects are finite, they can't be used to prove His infinite existence.
8. They say that cause and effect can't be proven if the effect isn't proportional to the cause.

**Article 2: Demonstration through effect (continued)**

9. To demonstrate something exists, we need to show it's not just a matter of possibility or potentiality.
10. The second way is to look at efficient causes, which are things that make other things happen.

**The First Way**

11. One way to prove God's existence is through the argument from motion.
12. We know that some things in the world are moving, and we can see it with our own eyes.

**Motion and Potentiality**

13. Whatever is moving must be put in motion by something else, because nothing can move itself.
14. But if everything that moves is moved by another thing, then there must be a first mover.
15. That first mover is what everyone calls God.

**The Second Way**

16. Another way to prove God's existence is through the nature of efficient causes.
17. We know that there are order and sequence in the world, with cause following effect.
18. But if we go on and on trying to find the cause of a cause, we'll never get to the end.

**The Third Way**

19. The third way to prove God's existence is through possibility and necessity.
20. We can think about things that are possible or necessary, and see how they relate to each other.

(Note: I had to break up the text into smaller sections because it was too long for a single summary. Let me know if you'd like me to continue with the rest of the text!)

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language:

**Section 1: The Nature of God**

* Question: Is God a body? 
	+ Objection 1: God seems to have a physical presence, as described in the Bible (e.g., "He is higher than Heaven...").
	+ Objection 2: God is said to be an image or figure, which implies a physical form.
	+ Objection 3: Scripture describes God as having physical attributes, such as eyes and arms.
	+ Objection 4: God's posture is described in the Bible (e.g., "I saw the Lord sitting").
	+ Objection 5: God is referred to as a local term ("wherefrom" or "whereto") in Scripture.
* On the contrary, it is written that God is a spirit (John 4:24).
* Response: It is absolutely true that God is not a body; this can be shown in three ways.

**Section 2: The Attributes of God**

* Question: Is God simple or composed?
	+ Objection 1: God seems to have multiple attributes, such as goodness and omnipotence.
	+ Objection 2: Scripture describes God's actions as having a purpose or end (e.g., "He designedly...").
	+ Objection 3: God is said to be the cause of all things, including natural bodies.

**Section 3: The Governance of the World**

* Question: Is there an intelligent being that directs the world?
	+ Objection 1: Natural bodies seem to act for a purpose (e.g., always moving in the same way).
	+ Objection 2: God is said to be the cause of all things, including natural bodies.

**Section 4: Reply to Objections**

* Response to Objection 1: Augustine says that God would not allow evil to exist unless it was part of His infinite goodness.
* Response to Objection 2: Whatever is done by nature must be traced back to God as its first cause.

**Section 5: The Simplicity of God**

* Question: Is God simple or composite?
	+ Objection 1: God seems to have multiple attributes, such as goodness and omnipotence.
	+ Objection 2: Scripture describes God's actions as having a purpose or end (e.g., "He designedly...").
	+ Objection 3: God is said to be the cause of all things, including natural bodies.

Note that these summaries are simplified and may not capture the full complexity of the original text.

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 1: Whether God is a Body**

* Question: Is God a body?
	+ Objection 1: It seems that God must be a body because it can move something to make it move.
	+ Objection 2: Even if we don't see God moving, maybe He's just resting and waiting for things to happen.
	+ Objection 3: If everything in the world is made of matter, then God must be too.
* Answer: No, God is not a body. We know this because God doesn't have any "stuff" inside Him like we do.

**Reply to Objections**

* Reply to Objection 1: Just because we can move something to make it move doesn't mean that the thing being moved has its own movement.
* Reply to Objection 2: Even if God is resting, He's still moving things around through His power.
* Reply to Objection 3: Just because everything in the world is made of matter doesn't mean that God is too. We need to look closer at what it means to be a body.

**Article 2: Whether God is Composed of Matter and Form**

* Question: Is God composed of matter and form?
	+ Objection 1: It seems that God must be composed of matter and form because we can say that God has a soul.
	+ Objection 2: Even if we don't understand what's happening, it seems like God might have feelings or emotions just like we do.
	+ Objection 3: If everything in the world is made up of individual parts, then God must be too.

**Reply to Objections**

* Reply to Objection 1: Just because we can say that God has a soul doesn't mean He's composed of matter and form. Maybe His actions are like those of a soul.
* Reply to Objection 2: Even if we don't understand what's happening, it might not be accurate to say that God has feelings or emotions just like we do.
* Reply to Objection 3: Just because everything in the world is made up of individual parts doesn't mean that God is too. We need to think more carefully about what "composed" means.

**Answer**

* It's impossible for matter to exist in God because matter needs potentiality, but God is pure actuality.
* If God were composed of matter and form, it would imply that He has imperfections or defects, which wouldn't be true.
* As the first agent, God must be primarily a form, not just an effect of some other form.

**Reply to Objections**

* Reply to Objection 1: When we say "God wills something," we mean that our soul is doing it for us. So when we say that something pleases God's soul, we're really saying that it pleases our own soul.
* Reply to Objection 2: Even if something looks like it has a feeling or emotion, maybe it's just acting in a way that makes it seem like it does.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 3**

* We need to understand how God's nature and existence are related.
* In composite things, the nature (essence) is different from the thing itself (suppositum).
* But in simple things, like God, the nature and existence might be the same.

**Reply to Objection 1**
We use concrete nouns when talking about God because we can't imagine how something so simple can exist.
Our language is limited, but that doesn't mean God's nature is composite or made up of different parts.

**Reply to Objection 2**
God's existence isn't just a property of Him; it's what He fundamentally is.
His existence is like His very being, not just an added quality.

**Article 4**

* We're wondering if God's essence and existence are the same thing.
* If they weren't, then God wouldn't have anything new beyond His nature.
* But that's not true: "God gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood" (Wisdom 14:21).

**Reply to Objection 1**
We can't know for sure what God is like or whether He exists, but we do know He has a certain kind of existence.
This existence isn't just any old thing; it's like His very being.

**Hilary's quote**
"Existence in God is not an accidental quality, but subsisting truth."

**Article 4**

* We need to show that God's essence and existence are the same.
* If one were different from the other, then something outside of God would have caused it.
* But God can't be caused by anything outside Himself; He's the first cause.

Here are some additional explanations for each article:

**Article 1**

This article is about how God's nature and existence relate to the world around us.
The author argues that we can understand God's nature because we know what a thing is when it has matter (form) and form (matter).
But if we're talking about simple things like God, then our understanding changes.

**Article 2**

This article is about how individual things (men, stones, etc.) are not the same as their essence.
The author explains that in composite things, there's a difference between what makes something what it is (nature) and what makes it this particular thing (suppositum).
But when we talk about simple things like God, then our understanding changes again.

**Article 3**

This article is about how we can understand God's nature.
The author explains that we use concrete nouns to talk about God because our language is limited.
We can't imagine how something so simple can exist, so we use words that help us picture it.

**Article 4**

This article is about how God's essence and existence relate to each other.
The author argues that if God's existence were different from His nature, then He would be caused by something outside of Himself.
But God can't be caused by anything; He's the first cause.

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 3: Existence**

* "Existence" refers to the fact that something actually exists.
* Think of it like a book on a shelf - it's not just the idea of a book, but the actual book itself that exists.

**Article 5: Whether God is contained in a genus? Objection 1**

* It seems that God should be included in a category or group (genus) because a substance is something that exists on its own.
* But this doesn't necessarily mean God fits into any specific genre or category.

**Objection 2**

* You can only measure something by something of the same type (genus).
* However, God isn't like other things - He's not just another substance that needs to be measured.

**Reply to Objection 1**

* The word "substance" refers not only to what exists independently but also to its inherent nature.
* But existence and essence are different things, so God can't be just any old substance.

**Article 5: Reply to Objection 2**

* Measuring something requires a common standard or reference point (proportionate measure).
* However, God isn't like that - He doesn't fit into any established scale or framework.

Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!

Here are SparkNotes-style summaries for each sentence in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 6: Whether in God there are any accidents?**

* Accidents refer to things that happen to something, like heat or wisdom.
* Some people think that accidents can be attributes of God, but this is a problem because it's not clear if they're really part of God's nature.

**Objection 1**

* If an accident can be an attribute of one thing, it can't be the essence (nature) of another thing, like fire and heat.
* This means that wisdom or virtue can't be what makes something a good being, because those things are already attributes of God.

**Objection 2**

* In every group of things, there's usually an "original" member, like how water is the original substance.
* But if accidents aren't in God, then there could be other beings that are accidents too, which would be weird.
* On the other hand, everything has to have a subject (like the air or water), so it can't really have accidents without a subject.

**Reply**

* There can't be any accidents in God because:
	+ A thing is like its parts, like how you're made up of different parts that come together to make you.
	+ God doesn't need anything else to exist (He's His own existence), so He can't really have potentiality or actuality like other things do.
	+ What makes something essential (its nature) can't be caused by something else, and what causes an accident in one thing is usually not the same for another.

**Reply to Objection 1**

* Virtue and wisdom aren't exactly the same as accidents because they're more like what makes a being good or noble.
* Even if they were the same, it wouldn't mean that God has accidents because those things are already part of His nature.

**Reply to Objection 2**

* Some things can be composite (made up of parts) without really needing other parts, like how the air is still air even when you breathe it out.
* Even if a single part of something doesn't have the same qualities as the whole thing, there's usually something that distinguishes one part from another.

**Article 7: The absolute simplicity of God**

* Some people think that God can't be simple (without parts) because some things are more perfect or complete.
* But if a being is truly simple, it means that it doesn't have any parts or composition, just its own essence.

**First Reason for Simplicity**

* From the previous articles, we know that God isn't made up of parts like a body, nor does His nature differ from His existence.
* This means that He can't be broken down into smaller parts and still be who He is.

**Second Reason for Simplicity**

* If something is composite, it's because it has parts that come together to make it what it is.
* But God is the first being (there's nothing before Him), so He can't really have any parts or composition.

**Third Reason for Simplicity**

* Every composite thing needs a cause (something else) to exist and be what it is.
* But God is the uncaused Cause, because He doesn't need anything else to exist (He's His own existence).

**Fourth Reason for Simplicity**

* In every composite thing, there are two sides: potentiality (what could be) and actuality (what really is).
* But God doesn't have this distinction between parts and whole, so He can't really be composite.

**Fifth Reason for Simplicity**

* When you say something about a single part of a composite thing, it's usually not the same as what you'd say about the whole thing.
* But God is His own essence (nature), so there's nothing outside of Himself that could be said about Him.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on anything!

Here's a modern language summary of the text in relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 8: Does God enter into the composition of other things?**

Some argue that God enters into the composition of other things because everything has its being from God. However, this is not necessarily true.

* Objection 1: If everything gets its being from God, then God must be part of every thing.
* But a form (like God) can't be part of a compound (like a human body). This creates a paradox.
* Proof for the minor point: things that differ must have differences. Since God and primary matter are simple and don't have differences, they can't be part of each other.

**On this topic**

There are three main errors in thinking about God's relationship to creation:

1. Some people think God is the world-soul, like Augustine.
2. Others believe God is the formal principle (form) of all things, which was an Almarician theory.
3. David of Dinant thought God was primary matter, which is absurd.

All these ideas are incorrect because:

* God can't be part of a compound as a formal or material principle.
* As the first cause, God acts independently and doesn't act through other things.
* No part of a compound can be absolutely primal among beings (not even matter or form).

**Reply to Objections**

1. The term "Godhead" refers to God's being as the efficient and exemplar cause, not as his essence.
2. The Word is an exemplar form that isn't part of a compound.
3. Simple things don't differ by added differences; they just have inherent differences.

**Question 75: Nature of the Soul**

This article explores various questions about the nature of the soul:

* Is the soul a body? (Objections 1-3)
	+ Objection 1: The soul is the moving principle of the body, so it must be a body.
	+ Objection 2: All knowledge comes from likeness, and the soul can't know corporeal things if it's not a body.
	+ Objection 3: There must be contact between the mover (soul) and the moved (body), which is only possible with bodies.
* Is the soul composed of matter and form?
* Is the soul incorruptible?

Here's a summary of the text in modern language, sentence by sentence:

**Point 1: The Soul is Not a Physical Body**

The soul is simple compared to the body because it doesn't take up space. To understand the nature of the soul, we need to start with the idea that the soul is defined as the first principle of life for living things.

**Objection 1: The Soul Must be Corporeal**

Some people think that the soul must be a physical body because they believe only bodies are real things and what isn't corporeal is nothing. However, this idea can be disproven by looking at universal and certain principles that show the soul is not a body.

**Point 2: Not All Principles of Life are Souls**

Not every principle of life is a soul. For example, the eye doesn't have to be moved to see because it's not a living thing. This shows that the soul can be separate from the body.

**Objection 1: The Soul Must be Moved**

Some people think that the soul must be moved because everything else in the world moves. However, this is true for some souls (like God) but not all (like humans).

**Point 3: The Soul Has Potentiality, Not Actuality**

The likeness of a thing known isn't actually in the nature of the knower, but rather in their potentiality. This means that the soul doesn't have to be a physical body to know about corporeal things.

**Objection 1: The Soul Must Be Corporeal to Know Bodies**

Some people thought that the soul had to be composed of the same principles as bodies in order to understand them, but this was an error because they failed to distinguish between actuality and potentiality.

**Point 4: The Soul Can Have Contact with Incorporeal Things**

There are two kinds of contact: quantity and power. The soul can have contact with incorporeal things through power, which is why it can move the body without being touched by a physical object.

**Article 1: Is the Human Soul Something Subsistent?**

The human soul isn't something subsistent because that implies it's a specific thing (like "this particular thing"). However, if we consider what Augustine said, then we should believe that the human soul is a substance and not just a body.

**Objection 1: The Soul Doesn't Operate**

Some people think that the soul doesn't operate because it can't do things like weave or build. However, this shows that the soul's operation is tied to the body's operation.

**Point 5: The Soul Must Be Incorporeal and Subsistent**

The principle of intellectual operation (the soul) must be both incorporeal and subsistent. This means it can't be a physical body but can still operate independently.

Here are the SparkNotes-style summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 1: Is the Intellectual Principle Something Subsistent?**

If the soul were a body, it couldn't know all bodies because different bodies have their own unique nature. So, the soul can't be a body.

It's also impossible for the soul to understand through a bodily organ because that would limit its ability to know everything. Think of how color seems to change when you look at a glass vase â€“ it's not just in your eyes!

This means the soul has an operation on its own, separate from the body. Only what exists independently can do something by itself.

**Article 2: Whether the Souls of Brute Animals are Subsistent**

Some people think the souls of animals are subsistent (exist independently), because humans and animals share the same kind of life ("genus"). But having the same "genus" doesn't mean being the same species. Species is determined by differences in form, not just similarities.

Others argue that since humans have an independent soul, other animals must too. But this isn't true. Think about how our senses work â€“ they're all connected to our bodies and don't exist independently like the intellect does.

**Key Points**

* The soul can't be a body because different bodies have unique natures.
* The soul has its own operation separate from the body.
* Animals' souls aren't subsistent (independent) like humans'.
* Existence and operations are connected, but the soul's independence is specific to the intellect.

**Summary**

The article explores whether animal souls exist independently. It argues that the soul can't be a body because different bodies have unique natures, and it has its own operation separate from the body. However, other animals' souls aren't subsistent like humans', and their existence is tied to their bodies and senses.

Here are the summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 1: How Intellect Operates**

The way we think is different from how our senses work. When we sense something, it changes our body too. This can affect how we understand things later on. But if our body gets tired during thinking, it's not because the intellect needs the body to work - it's just that our senses are necessary for creating images in our minds.

**Article 2: Is the Soul of an Animal?**

Some people think animals have souls like humans do, but that's not true. Animals and humans share some similarities, but they're also different. We can't use the same logic to say animals have souls as we would with humans.

**Key Points**

* The soul can't be a body because bodies are unique.
* The soul has its own operation separate from the body.
* Animal souls aren't subsistent (independent) like human souls.
* Existence and operations are connected, but the soul's independence is specific to the intellect.

**Article 3: Is Man a Soul?**

There are two ways to understand this question. First, some people think that man is just his soul - which is not true because our senses can't function without our bodies. Second, if we assume that thinking is only possible for the soul, then it would be like using a tool to do something (like a hammer). In that case, the thing doing the work could be called "man".

**Article 4: Is Man Composed of Matter and Form?**

Some people think that matter and form are necessary for anything to exist. But others say that just because we're in a state of potentiality (which means we have the potential to become something), it doesn't mean we have to be made up of material stuff.

**Article 5: Objections**

There are four different ways to think about whether the soul is composed of matter and form:

1. Just because we can do things in a state of potentiality, it means we must be made up of primary matter.
2. Since our souls have properties like being a subject for science or virtue, that means they must contain material.
3. If something doesn't have material, it can't have a cause of existence - but the soul is created by God and so it must have material.
4. Something that's just a form (without any material) is considered pure and infinite - which only belongs to God.

**Reply to Objections**

* Article 1: The way we think can be like using a tool, so sometimes what's principle in us is called "man".
* Article 3: Not every part of something is a person or a hypostasis (a complete entity).
* Article 5: Just because we're in potentiality doesn't mean we have to be made up of material stuff.

Here are the summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article VII: What Does It Mean to Say the Soul Was Made Neither of Corporeal Matter Nor of Spiritual Matter?**

The question of what it means to say the soul was made neither of corporeal matter nor of spiritual matter is important. In general, the soul can be thought of as the form of a body. This can happen in two ways: either the soul is a whole and complete entity on its own, or it is part of something else.

**Article VIII: The Nature of the Intellectual Soul**

The intellectual soul is different from primary matter because it receives absolute forms, not just individual forms like other things do. Because of this, the potentiality of the intelligence is one thing, while the potentiality of primary matter is another. This means that there are different reasons for subjection and change in each.

**Reply to Objection 1: The First Act**

The First Act is the universal principle of all acts because it is infinite and contains all things within itself. Things participate in this act not because they are part of it, but because they are affected by its processions. This means that potentiality is proportionate to act, but the acts received from the First Act are diverse.

**Reply to Objection 2: The Potentiality of the Intelligence**

The potentiality of the intelligence is different from that of primary matter because the intelligence is subject to knowledge and change through its potentiality with regard to intelligible species. This means that the existence of a potentiality in the intellectual soul does not prove that it is composed of matter and form.

**Reply to Objection 3: The Form**

The form causes matter to exist and to be actualized, just like the agent. However, a subsistent form has its own existence and is not caused by some external principle or process.

**Reply to Objection 4: Participated Existence**

Participated existence means that something exists because it participates in another thing's existence. In the case of intellectual substances, this means that they are composed of actuality and potentiality, but not of matter and form. Some say that they are composed of their own "whereby" or "that which they are," meaning their own essence.

**Article VI: Is the Human Soul Incorruptible?**

The question of whether the human soul is incorruptible is important. Two arguments suggest that it might not be:

1. If things have a similar beginning and process, they should have a similar end. Since the souls of animals are corruptible, the human soul might also be corruptible.
2. Whatever exists out of nothing can return to nothingness, so why shouldn't the human soul do the same?

However, these arguments are not conclusive, and there is more to consider about the nature of the human soul and its relationship to corruption.

Here are the summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article VII: What Does It Mean to Say the Soul Was Made Neither of Corporeal Matter Nor of Spiritual Matter?**

The question of what it means to say the soul was made neither of corporeal matter nor of spiritual matter is important. In general, the soul can be thought of as the form of a body.

**Article VIII: The Nature of the Intellectual Soul**

The intellectual soul receives knowledge and understands things without any contradiction or opposition. This means that the soul's nature is not subject to change or corruption.

**Reply to Objection 1: Solomon's Argument**

Solomon argues that the human body and animals are created from the same earth, but humans are created by God through a process of breath and life. Therefore, it is false to say that humans have nothing more than beasts in terms of their soul.

**Reply to Objection 2: The Ultimate Specific Difference**

The ultimate specific difference between an angel and the human soul is not found in anything more noble or better. Instead, it lies in the nature of their existence and purpose.

**Article IX: Whether the Soul is of the Same Species as an Angel?**

The question of whether the soul is of the same species as an angel is a matter of debate. Some argue that they share the same end goal of eternal happiness, which would suggest that they are of the same species.

However, others argue that there must be some ultimate specific difference between the two, and that their intellectual nature is not more noble than that of angels.

**General Summary**

The text argues that the soul is incorruptible because it receives knowledge and understands things without any contradiction or opposition. This means that its nature is not subject to change or corruption, and that it shares no ultimate specific differences with angels.

Here are the summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article VII: Are Soul and Angel of the Same Species?**

Soul and angel agree that they belong to the same species, but this seems unlikely because soul is connected to a physical body, while angel isn't.

**Objection 3**

If we consider only how soul and angel are joined with their respective bodies, it might seem like they aren't of the same species. However, since an angel doesn't have a body, its "nature" might not be fully understood.

**Contrary Argument**

According to Dionysius, angels have simple and blessed intelligence that's different from how human souls learn about God (since we rely on visible things). This suggests that soul and angel are indeed of different species.

**My Response**

Origen believed that all human souls and angels share the same species because they're both made up of non-corporeal substances, which can't be divided in number without becoming a separate species. However, this isn't true; incorporeal substances have differences in nature, just like other things do.

**Explanation for Diversity of Species**

If we had two forms that were separate (like different colors), each would still belong to the same general category (since they're both forms). The same principle applies here: if soul and angel are different, they can't be of the same species.

**Reply to Objection 1**

This argument focuses on what makes a thing perfect or imperfect. If we compare things within the same genus, we should compare them as being either more or less perfect (since they're both part of that category). However, when comparing different genera (like between soul and angel), we can't use the same criteria.

**Reply to Objection 2**

If the intellect were united with the body as its form, it would mean the intellect has a fixed nature, which contradicts what we know about its ability to understand all things.

**Article 1: Is Intellectual Principle United to Body?**

**Objection 1**

The Philosopher says that the intellect is separate and not part of any physical thing. This suggests that intellectual principle isn't united with the body as its form.

**Objection 2**

If the intellect were united with the body, it would need to share the same nature as the matter (the physical substance) it's forming. However, this wouldn't make sense since we know the intellect can understand non-physical things.

**Objection 3**

The form of a thing received by an organ is specific to that organ, whereas the form of something understood is universal and abstract. This means the intellect isn't united with the body in the way its form would be if it were part of the physical substance.

Let me know if you'd like me to continue summarizing these questions!

Here are the summaries in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Objection 5: Intellectual Principle and Body**

If something exists on its own, it can't be part of the body as a form. The intellectual principle is separate from the body because it has existence that's not dependent on the body.

**Objection 6: Matter and Form**

The form (intellectual principle) can't exist without matter because the form acts on the matter to make something real. But the intellectual principle remains separate from the body even after death, so it can't be a part of the body as its form.

**Counterargument**

Differentiation comes from the form, and the difference that makes us who we are is related to the soul. The action of understanding is what makes someone who they are, just like how health is what makes our bodies healthy.

**Main Argument**

The first thing that sustains our life is the soul (the intellect). Understanding is a vital function, and the principle of understanding (intellect) is what makes us human. Just like how health is a form of our body, knowledge is a form of our soul.

**Counterargument to "Intellectual Soul Not Form of Body"**

If someone says the intellectual soul isn't the form of the body, they need to explain why this particular action (understanding) belongs to this person specifically. We can only say that something understands or acts through its whole self, not just a part of it.

**Counterargument to "Intellectual as Motor for Body"**

It's absurd to think that the intellect moves the body directly because the intellect doesn't control physical movement on its own; it works with our appetite and emotions.

Here's a simplified summary of the text in modern language:

**Why Socrates understands**

Socrates' understanding isn't because his intellect moves him, but rather because he understands himself through his intellect.

**The nature of the soul**

If the intellect isn't considered the form (essence) of the body, it means the intellect is separate from the body. But this idea doesn't fit with Aristotle's view that our actions are influenced by our understanding.

**Understanding as a motor**

Just like how a carpenter uses a saw to shape wood, Socrates might be seen as using his understanding (intellect) to move himself. However, this isn't how Aristotle thinks it works - we can't attribute the action of understanding to Socrates directly.

**The nature of human beings**

Our species is defined by our ability to understand and reason, which sets us apart from other animals. This means that our intellect (or "soul") must be considered the form (essence) of humanity.

**The nobility of forms**

The more noble a form is, the more it excels matter. Since human beings have the most noble form (intellect), we are capable of actions and powers that aren't accessible to other living things.

**What does it mean to be human?**

Aristotle argues that our species is defined by our ability to understand and reason. This understanding is what makes us human, and it's connected to our intellect or "soul".

Some key points to consider:

*   Our understanding (intellect) is separate from the body but also connected to it.
*   Understanding is a fundamental aspect of being human, and it defines our species as a whole.
*   The nobility of forms means that higher forms (like human intellect) excelled matter.

Overall, Aristotle's view is that our understanding (intellect) is what makes us human, and it's connected to but also separate from the physical body.

Here's a simplified summary:

**Article 1: The Nature of the Soul**

The soul is like a light body - when it leaves its place, it still has an inclination to return. Even though the human soul can be separated from the body, it still has an innate tendency to rejoin it.

**Objection 1: Is There One Intellect in All Men?**

If the intellect isn't multiplied according to the number of bodies, there must be only one intellect for all men. This is because immaterial substances like the soul can't be divided within a species.

**Objection 2: What Happens When the Cause (Body) Is Removed?**

If there were multiple souls for each body, removing the bodies would leave no souls behind. Instead, we'd be left with just one remainder - which goes against the idea of rewards and punishments based on individual deeds.

**Objection 3: How Do We Understand Universals?**

Our intellect can't understand things individually; it must grasp universals (general ideas). If multiple intellects existed for each person, they wouldn't be able to do this.

**Objection 4: What About Knowledge and Understanding?**

If there were multiple intellects for each person, knowledge would become individualized, contradicting the nature of our understanding.

**Objection 5: How Does Learning Happen?**

When a disciple learns from a master, their knowledge can't be created by the master's knowledge. This implies that there's only one intellect sharing knowledge between individuals.

**Objection 6: What About Philosophers and Their Opinions?**

Philosophers like Aristotle and Plato have different views on this topic, but ultimately, it's clear that there can't be multiple intellects in one person.

Aristotle argues against the idea of multiple souls for each individual. He believes our intellect is a part of our soul and forms man. If there were multiple intellects, they wouldn't be able to have just one existence or form, which goes against nature.

Here's a SparkNotes-style summary of the text in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**The Nature of the Soul**

Aristotle argues that there can't be multiple souls for each individual. He believes our intellect is a part of our soul and forms man, just like how our body forms us.

**Objection 1: Is There One Intellect in All Men?**

Aristotle responds by saying that if there were multiple souls, it would mean that the same intellect could have different actions based on different phantasms (impressions). However, this would be impossible because a single intellect can only produce one intelligible species (a general idea) from different phantasms.

**Objection 2: What Happens When the Cause (Body) Is Removed?**

Aristotle says that just like how we have unity in being and existence, we also have unity in our intellectual soul. Even after the body is dissolved, the intellectual soul retains its own being and can still understand the nature of a thing.

**Objection 3: Individuality of the Intelligent Being vs. Universals**

Aristotle argues that individuality doesn't exclude understanding universals. In fact, separate intellects (or souls) could understand universals if they had a common form or species. However, material conditions can make it difficult for knowledge to be universal.

**Objection 4: What is Understood vs. the Likeness of the Intellect**

Aristotle says that what's understood is one thing, regardless of whether there's one intellect or many. The understanding is not about the individual intellect itself, but rather its likeness to the thing being understood.

**Objection 5: Different Knowers and One Object**

Aristotle responds by saying that different people (including a disciple and a master) can understand the same object in their own way, based on their unique perspectives or phantasms.

**Objection 6**

(Note: This objection is not fully responded to in the text. If you'd like, I can try to provide a brief summary of how Aristotle might respond to this objection.)

Overall, Aristotle's argument is that there can't be multiple souls for each individual because it would lead to contradictions and make understanding difficult. He believes that our intellect is a single entity that forms man, and that we can understand universals even if we're individual entities ourselves.

Here's a SparkNotes-style summary of the text in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Augustine's Argument Against Plurality of Souls**

Augustine thinks that if there were multiple souls, they would have to be different species. He argues that this is impossible because the intellectual soul is incorruptible (won't die), while other souls are corruptible (will die). This means that their essence can't be the same.

**Objection 1: Sensitive and Nutritive Souls**

The objection says that just like how we have different parts in our body, we might also have different souls. The sensitive soul is in charge of sensing things, while the nutritive soul helps us eat and digest food. But if this is true, then it's hard to say that all these souls are connected to the same essence.

**Objection 2: Animal and Human Souls**

The second objection says that animals are created before they become humans. This means that their sensitive soul comes first, which contradicts the idea of a separate intellectual soul. If our soul were divided into different parts, it would be hard to explain how one soul can exist in multiple forms.

**Objection 3: Soul and Matter**

The third objection says that Plato thought of the soul as being connected to the body like its form (like a blueprint). But if this is true, then it's not possible for there to be multiple souls in one body. Instead, each part of the body would have its own separate soul.

**Plato's View**

Plato believed that there were multiple souls in one body, each connected to different parts of the body (like the liver, heart, and brain). Aristotle rejected this view because it would mean that the various principles of the soul's operations were different and distributed throughout the body. But if that's true, then how can we explain how one soul controls all these separate functions?

**Aristotle's Response**

Aristotle thinks that Plato's idea is wrong because if there are multiple souls, they wouldn't be connected to the same essence. Instead, each soul would have its own separate existence. He argues that it's impossible for multiple souls to exist in one body if they're not connected to a single form (essence).

**Aristotle's Reasoning**

Aristotle thinks that things can't be divided into different parts and still be the same thing. If we look at how we use language, we see that things can only have one name or label (e.g., "a white man"). This means that if there are multiple souls in one body, they wouldn't be able to exist as separate entities.

**Conclusion**

Augustine argues against the idea of multiple souls in one body because it leads to contradictions and paradoxes. Aristotle agrees with Augustine that Plato's view is flawed because it can't explain how a single soul controls all different functions in the body.

Here's a sentence-by-sentence SparkNotes summary of the text in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**The Problem with Having Multiple Souls**

In this passage, Aristotle argues that having multiple souls in one body leads to contradictions and paradoxes. He says that if we have two forms - one for being an animal and another for being a man - it's impossible to explain how they can both be true at the same time.

**The Consequences of Having Multiple Souls**

Aristotle argues that if we had multiple souls, one of the consequences would be that Socrates would be both a man and an animal by different souls. But he thinks this is absurd because a single soul should contain all aspects of human nature.

**Why the Intellectual Soul is Not Just Sensible**

In response to critics, Aristotle explains that the intellectual soul is not just sensitive but also incorruptible because it has intellectuality as one of its qualities. This means that even if the soul is sensitive, its intellectuality keeps it from being corruptible.

**The Different Ways We Classify Things**

Aristotle argues that we classify things differently based on their composites (i.e., what they are made of) rather than just their forms. He says that man is not just a generic animal but has some distinct qualities, like being able to move himself.

**The Embryo's Development**

Aristotle explains how the embryo develops from a sensitive soul to an intellectual soul as it grows and matures. This process involves the removal of one soul and the replacement with another more perfect one.

**Why We Shouldn't Overcomplicate Things**

In response to critics, Aristotle argues that we shouldn't overcomplicate our understanding of nature by considering multiple forms or logical notions. He says that reason can apprehend one thing in many ways, but it should focus on what's common and shared between things rather than trying to distinguish them too sharply.

**The Question of Whether There Is Another Form Besides the Intellectual Soul**

In this section, Aristotle addresses critics who argue that there must be another form besides the intellectual soul. He responds by saying that the soul is not just a physical body with life potentially but also has an act or activity that makes it exist as a whole.

**Objection 1: The Body Needs Another Form**

Aristotle's critic argues that the body needs another substantial form besides the soul, which would precede the soul and make the body what it is. Aristotle responds by saying that primary matter (i.e., matter before anything else exists) cannot be moved and must have a more perfect form.

**Objection 2: The Body Needs Another Form Because of Movement**

Aristotle's critic argues that since animals move themselves, there must be another part of the body that can be moved. Aristotle responds by saying that this other part must be something less than the soul because it's not capable of moving itself.

**Objection 3: The Order of Forms Depends on Their Relation to Primary Matter**

Aristotle's critic argues that if there weren't another substantial form besides the rational soul, it would rank as one of the most imperfect forms. Aristotle responds by saying that this is a false assumption because the order of forms depends on their relation to primary matter.

**Objection 4: The Human Body Is a Mixed Body**

Aristotle's critic argues that since the human body has both animal and plant parts, there must be another form besides the intellectual soul. Aristotle responds by saying that this is true but doesn't necessarily mean that there are multiple forms; it just means that the human body has complex structures that need to be understood in a nuanced way.

Here's a SparkNotes-style summary of the text in modern language:

**Main Argument**

Aristotle argues that the human soul has two aspects: intellectual and sensitive. The sensitive soul deals with physical sensations, while the intellectual soul is responsible for thoughts and reason. He claims that there cannot be another substantial form (or underlying reality) besides the intellectual soul because it gives being simply.

**Response to Objections**

1. Aristotle responds to an objection that says his definition of "act" refers only to a body's potentiality, not its actualized state. However, he argues that the act is still included in the soul itself.
2. He addresses another objection by explaining how the soul uses motive power (i.e., its inner drive) to move the body, rather than just its essence.
3. Aristotle notes that forms come in varying degrees of perfection and argues that a form which only gives one degree of perfection is not substantial enough.
4. In response to an objection about Avicenna's view on mixed bodies, Aristotle explains that the elements' forms cannot be averaged out or modified because their distinction relies on dimensions (i.e., size) that matter doesn't have.

**Key Concepts**

* Substantial form: a fundamental aspect of reality that gives being to something
* Intellectual soul: responsible for reason and thoughts
* Sensitive soul: deals with physical sensations
* Act/ Potentiality: Aristotle's concept of the underlying reality of a thing
* Form/Matter: Aristotle distinguishes between the underlying reality (form) and the material substance (matter)

**Main Claim**

The human soul is the only substantial form in humans because it gives being simply, and there cannot be another form that does the same.

**Tone and Style**

Aristotle's text has a formal, philosophical tone. He uses complex vocabulary and assumes some knowledge of Aristotelian concepts.

Here's a sentence-by-sentence SparkNotes summary in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Section 1: The Form of Elements Remains in a Mixed Body**

The forms of the elements remain in the mixed body, even though the actual matter is different. This means that the proper qualities of the elements are still present, but they're modified to some extent. The power of the elementary forms also remains.

**Section 2: Objection 1 - Intellectual Soul not Properly United**

It seems that the intellectual soul isn't properly united to a corruptible body because matter should be proportionate to form. However, the intellectual soul is incorruptible, so it's hard to see how it could be combined with a physical body.

**Section 3: Objection 2 - Intellectual Soul Should be United to a Subtle Body**

The intellectual soul should be united to a subtle body, like fire, because it's immaterial and perfect. But the soul also needs an organ for sense perception, which means a body with a balanced temperament.

**Section 4: Objection 3 - Intellect Can't Produce Varieties of Species**

One form can't produce different species, but the intellectual soul is one form itself. This seems to suggest that it shouldn't be combined with bodies composed of different parts belonging to various species.

**Section 4 (continued) - Intellect and Body Relationship**

The intellectual soul requires a body of balanced temperament, which can be imperfect due to its material nature. However, God's gift of grace provides a remedy against death, so we focus on what's suitable for natural things rather than what God might do in this case.

**Section 5: Objection 1 Reply - Incorruptible Body Before Sin**

Someone might argue that before sin the human body was incorruptible. However, this isn't relevant because the immortality of the body came from divine grace, not its natural state.

**Section 5 (continued) - Replying to Objections**

We acknowledge that two conditions apply: one chosen for the material to be suitable to the form, and another that follows naturally due to the first condition. The artisan chooses iron for a saw, but it becomes blunt and rusted over time. Similarly, God provides a remedy against death through grace.

**Section 6: Objection 2 Reply - Intellectual Soul Needs a Balanced Body**

The intellectual soul doesn't need a body by reason of its intellectual operation, but because of its sensitive power, which requires an organ with balanced temperament. This is necessary for sense perception, and it's not possible to have an equable complexion without a mixed body.

**Section 7: Objection 3 Reply - Parts Don't Define Species**

The parts of an animal, like the eye or hand, don't define its species; rather, they're part of what makes up the whole. So, we can't say that different parts belong to different species, but rather that they have varying dispositions.

Here's a sentence-by-sentence SparkNotes summary in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

**Article 5: The Intellectual Soul is Suitable to the Body**

The intellectual soul is suitable to the body because it needs different parts to perform its various operations, which explains why there's a greater variety of parts in perfect animals compared to imperfect ones and even more so in plants.

**Reply to Objection 4: The Intellectual Soul and Infinite Power**

The intellectual soul has infinite power because it can understand universals, but this doesn't mean it needs fixed natural notions or means for its existence. Instead, the soul makes matter exist absolutely through its substantial form.

**Article 6: The Intellect is Not Uniting to Matter Before Its Form**

It's impossible for any accidental disposition to exist in matter before the intellectual soul, because the first act of all things is existence, and matter can't be understood as having quantity or other properties before it exists absolutely. The soul makes matter actual through its substantial form.

**Reply to Objection 1: Dispositions in Matter Before the Form**

While matter may be considered perfected in its existence before being understood as corporeal, those accidents that belong to existence (like dimensions of quantity) can still be understood as existing before the body. This doesn't mean dispositions exist in matter before the form.

**Reply to Objection 2: Dispositions and Forms**

The intellectual soul is united to the body as a form, not just by virtue or power, because it guides and moves the body through its very being. The soul's substantial form makes it one with the body, unlike when breathing ceases and the soul separates from the body.

**Reply to Objection 3: Link Between Soul and Body**

A link between two things is that thing removed which involves their separation; in this case, the breath (a subtle body) serves as a means of union between the soul and body. However, the question remains whether there's something "between" the soul and body that unites them.

**Article 7: The Soul is Not Uniting to an Animal Body by Means of Another Body**

It seems that the soul might be united to the animal body by means of another body (like fire or air), but this isn't necessarily true. Instead, the soul's substantial form makes it one with the body, and the breath serves as a link between them.

**Reply to Objection 1: The Soul and Breath**

Augustine's statement that the soul administers the body by light could imply that fire and air (bodily forms) serve as links between the soul and body. However, this interpretation isn't necessary.

**Reply to Objection 2: Link Between Soul and Body**

A link between two things involves something removed that leads to their separation; in this case, breathing ceases when the soul separates from the body. This doesn't necessarily mean there's a bodily form (like breath) that unites them.

**Reply to Objection 3: Distance and Union**

Things that are distant can be united by a mediator between them; however, the question remains whether there's something specifically "between" the soul and body that unites them.

Here's a modern language, relatively easy vocabulary summary of the text:

**The Nature of the Soul**

The soul and body are connected, but they're separate things. The soul is like a non-corporeal (non-physical) entity that can't be seen or touched.

Some philosophers think there must be an intermediate substance (like a spiritual body) that connects the soul to the body. However, this idea doesn't make sense because light isn't a physical thing and it can't bridge the gap between the non-corporeal soul and the physical body.

**The Soul's Union with the Body**

The philosopher Aristotle says that the soul is united to the body in two ways: as a motor (like a driver controlling a car) or as its form (its essential nature). If the soul were only connected as a motor, it would need another substance to act upon. But if it's connected as its form, it can't be separated from the body.

The form is what makes something exist in reality. It's like an active agent that brings things into being. Since the soul is the form of the human body, it must be present in every part of the body.

**The Soul's Presence in Each Part of the Body**

Some people argue that the whole soul isn't present in each individual part of the body (like a finger or an eye). However, this idea doesn't hold up because if we consider the whole body as one unit, it makes sense for the soul to be connected to every part.

One philosopher says that the soul is like a master who controls all parts of the body. If the soul were only present in some parts, it wouldn't be able to control them properly.

**The Soul's Relationship to Each Part of the Body**

Another argument suggests that if the whole soul is present in each part of the body, then every part would become an entire individual (like a separate person). However, this idea doesn't work because the soul is like a single entity that encompasses all parts.

In conclusion, the soul and body are connected through the form, which is the essential nature of the human being. The soul must be present in every part of the body to function properly.

Here's a sentence-by-sentence summary of the text in modern language with relatively easy vocabulary:

1. The soul doesn't just exist in the whole body, but also in every single part of it.

2. This idea comes from Aristotle, who said that the soul is like a master that controls all parts of the body.

3. If the soul were only present in some parts, it wouldn't be able to control them properly, like a driver controlling a car doesn't need to be present in each individual wheel.

4. Some people think that if the whole soul is present in each part of the body, then every part would become an entire individual, like a separate person.

5. But this idea doesn't work because the soul is like a single entity that encompasses all parts, not like a small part that can be separated from the rest.

6. Instead, the soul must be present in every part of the body to function properly, like a single engine powering an entire vehicle.

7. This means that when we lose our soul, we don't speak of a hand or eye unless they're artificially created, like a painted animal or a statue.

8. A proof of this is that when the soul leaves the body, no part retains its proper action, even if it still has the species (or characteristics) of that part.

9. This shows that the soul must be in every part of the body to function properly, not just in one part or the other.

10. To understand why, we need to consider three kinds of totality: quantity, logic, and potentiality.

11. The first kind (quantity) doesn't apply to forms, except maybe accidentally, like whiteness on a surface.

12. But the second kind (logic) does belong to forms, including the soul, because it's essential to their nature.

13. And the third kind (potentiality) also belongs to forms, including the soul, because they have the power to act and operate.

14. Now, when it comes to the soul's relationship with each part of the body, we need to distinguish between totality of species, essence, power, and perfection.

15. If we mean totality of species or essence, then the whole soul is indeed present in each part of the body, but if we mean totality of power or perfection, then it's not that simple.

16. The soul has different powers for different parts of the body, like sight in the eye and hearing in the ear.

17. So when someone asks whether the whole whiteness is in the whole surface or each part of it, we need to consider what kind of totality they're referring to.

18. If it's accidental (like whiteness on a surface), then the answer is no, but if it's essential (like the soul's nature), then yes.

19. Finally, we need to remember that the soul has different relations to different parts of the body, and its relation to the whole body is primary and essential, while its relation to individual parts is secondary and subordinate.
